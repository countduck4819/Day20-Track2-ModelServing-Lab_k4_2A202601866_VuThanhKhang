Highest sampled value was **3.88 of 4** slots. Note this gauge is llama.cpp's *average* busy slots per decode step, so the number below is the highest average we sampled, not an instantaneous maximum batch width. A peak near 1 means
requests were served one at a time -- either the load was too light to overlap, or
they arrived too far apart. A peak approaching `--parallel` means the scheduler was
genuinely packing concurrent requests into shared decode steps.
`requests_deferred` went above zero: more requests arrived than there were slots, so some waited. That wait is the queue time in your P95.

## Your observation

The peak observed batch width was 3.88 of 4 slots (97%), while all 4 requests
processing slots were occupied and as many as 46 requests were deferred. This is
strong evidence that continuous batching was active and that the scheduler was
packing almost every available slot into shared decode steps. The effective
concurrency reported by the load test was 7.8, which is higher than the four
physical decode slots because Little's Law counts both actively processed and
queued requests. Therefore, the two measurements do not conflict. I trust the
server gauge for actual slot utilization and use effective concurrency as evidence
of total system occupancy, including queueing.
